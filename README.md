# Pokedex
Pokédex Website

I created a website called Pokédex, which features a collection of Pokémon cards. The site allows users to search for Pokémon by name using a search button. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main functionality of the website includes displaying various Pokémon cards and enabling an easy search experience to find specific Pokémon by typing their names.

Features:

Pokémon Card Collection: A variety of Pokémon cards are displayed.
Search Functionality: Users can search for Pokémon by entering their names.
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be user-friendly and works well on different screen sizes.
The site offers a simple yet interactive way to explore the world of Pokémon!
